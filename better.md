# Pix's Necronomicon of Software

This is inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) repos that have lead me to cool tools, so this is just my take on that, a list of awesome software I've found while passing through cyberspace

This list will likely have a cyber security lean just cause of my line of work, but will include anything I've found that I think is cool or useful.

Please send me cool tools to try! I'm always looking for more new awesome stuff to try!
